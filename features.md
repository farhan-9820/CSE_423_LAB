# Game Feature Design Document

## 1. Creating the Maze (Wall Buildup)  
The core environment will be a dynamically generated maze with walls that form pathways, dead ends, and hidden routes. These walls act as both barriers and strategic elements, guiding exploration and determining how both player and enemies move across the map.  

## 2. Player Movement  
The player can freely navigate the maze corridors. In addition to standard walking, the player has the ability to **jump**, allowing access to elevated spots, crossing small obstacles, or avoiding traps strategically.  

## 3. Creating the Enemy  
The maze is populated by enemies that pursue or block the player. Each enemy is designed with unique mechanics to increase challenge and variety.  

## 4. Enemy Types: Ranged + Melee  
- **Ranged Enemies**: Capable of casting **spells** such as fireballs, ice blasts, or magic projectiles, forcing the player to dodge or counter them.  
- **Melee Enemies**: These rely on close-range attacks and can be differentiated through **movement speed** or **buffs** (e.g., higher damage output, temporary shields).  

## 5. Enemy Status Effects  
Enemies can impose conditions on the player during combat, such as **paralysis**, **stun**, **burn**, or **freeze**, temporarily restricting player actions or reducing their effectiveness in battle.  

## 6. Player Item Pickup (Guns)  
The player can acquire weapons (e.g., guns) scattered throughout the maze. These items provide ranged attack capabilities, offering tactical advantages against both melee and ranged enemies.  

## 7. Bridges and Towers  
Certain sections of the maze are connected through **bridges or towers**, enabling players to access otherwise unreachable map locations or hidden parts of the labyrinth.  

## 8. Magic Item Pickups  
Collectible magic items grant temporary or permanent **buffs**, such as **health restoration**, **increased attack power**, or **reduced attack strength** (if cursed). These pickups add depth to exploration and reward discovery.  

## 9. Camera Perspective  
The game’s camera is tailored to the **player’s perspective**, ensuring that navigation, combat, and exploration are visually intuitive and immersive.  

## 10. Combat System  
The player can directly **attack enemies**, and enemies will retaliate. Combat outcomes are influenced by previously acquired items and buffs, ensuring that progression directly impacts survivability and damage potential.  

## 11. Cheat Mode: Invisible Walls  
A special “cheat mode” introduces **invisible walls** within the maze, creating hidden boundaries or shortcuts that alter navigation and challenge perception.  

## 12. Player Position Shifts Over Time  
After a certain duration, the player’s position will automatically **change or shift** to a different part of the maze, simulating disorientation and adding unpredictability to gameplay.  

## 13 & 14. Quiz Mechanic and Guardian Encounter  
At the end of the maze, the player must complete a **quiz**.  
- Failure to answer correctly results in **no key being awarded**.  
- The **guardian transforms into an enemy** that must be fought to proceed.


## 15. Game Restart or Pause  
Core functionality includes the ability to **pause gameplay** or **restart the maze**, allowing players to reset progress or regroup after failure.
